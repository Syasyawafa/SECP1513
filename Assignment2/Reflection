Group reflection: Attending this event will help us learn more about technology information, especially when you are in the Telekom Malaysia region. You can explore whiteboards that allow you to do a variety of things with your presentations.
My own reflection: The UTM digital visit has been a testament to the institution's commitment to leveraging technology for educational and administrative purposes. Navigating through the virtual campus, I witnessed how digital tools and platforms are seamlessly integrated into various aspects of student life, from academic resources to collaborative spaces and administrative services.
