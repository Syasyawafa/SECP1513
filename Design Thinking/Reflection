I'm from a Computer Science (Bioinformatics) course. My goal regarding my course is to become Computational Biology. I choose this course because I can practice  to conducts analysis using computational and mathematical methods and large set. Though this course is difficult, I think this course can help me to produce new project regarding to my research. The design thinking that we work on it will probably help me to know how to use app and find the solution to solve the issue that we face. That's why I need to improve my social skills, so that I can communicate with others more easily. Then, I need to improve my schedule to help manage my time properly.
