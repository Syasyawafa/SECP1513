My own reflection: I am inspired to cultivate a collaborative mindset, mirroring Dr. Seah Choon Sen's teachings. I aim to engage with diverse perspectives within I-farm, recognizing that collective intelligence is key to addressing complex agricultural challenges and fostering innovative solutions.
