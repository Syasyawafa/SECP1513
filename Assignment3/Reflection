My own reflection: The industrial talk emphasized how important it is to work as a team and develop soft skills in the workplace. It made me think about how crucial teamwork, empathy, and clear communication are. I now understand how crucial these abilities are to creating a productive workplace and accomplishing group projects successfully.
